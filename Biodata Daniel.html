		<p>Lee Ji-eun (Korean: 이지은; born May 16, 1993), also known by her stage name IU (아이유), is a South Korean singer-songwriter, composer, and actress. She signed with LOEN Entertainment (now Kakao Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with Lost and Found (2008), her first extended play (EP). Although her follow-up albums, Growing Up and IU...IM, brought mainstream success, it was only after the release of "Good Day", the lead single from her 2010 album Real, that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019, it was ranked number one on Billboard's "100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s" list. </p>
		
		<b><p>Pendidikan<p></b>
		<p>During her middle school years, IU found her passion for singing and decided to become a singer after being applauded for a performance she gave at her school's sports competition. She attended 20 auditions but failed to succeed in any of them, and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies. She later trained at Good Entertainment with Uee, Yubin, Heo Ga-yoon, and Jun Hyo-seong. After signing with LOEN Entertainment in 2007, she moved to Bangbae, Seoul. Due to her poor living conditions at the time, IU stated that she "loved being at the studio", where she could eat as much as she wanted and had a place to sleep.

Her burgeoning career led to her decreased attendance at school and declining grades, with the exception of Korean literature. After graduating from Dongduk Girls' High School in 2012, IU decided not to pursue post-secondary education in tandem with her singing career.</p>

		<b><p>Hobi<p></b>
		<p>IU recently revealed her hobby of cooking and her shocking favorite dish to make.

During her appearance on 'Quiz to Change the World', IU revealed her hobby of cooking first began because "show programs these days require stars to cook".

When asked which dish she cooks the best, IU answered, "I make really good peach flat rice cake ddukbokki (spicy rice cake dish)." She explained, "When I usually make ddukbokki I add apples and onions to the spicy sauce, but one time I added peach because I didn't have apples. The peach got sweeter as it cooked and made the dish really delicious."</p>
